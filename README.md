<h1 align="center"> PRIMEr </h1>
Tar heel gameplay is a tool built at UNC-Chapel Hill by Gary Bishop to allow anyone to create game like experiences with
already existing gameplay footage. These are meant to be played by people with learning disabilities as they simplify the 
game immensely. 
<br><br>


PRIMEr is a "primer" of sorts for this website, listed <a href="https://www.tarheelgameplay.org">here</a>. This means that it takes in 
videos of gameplay and "prepares" them to be played like video games. It does this by asking a user for "actions" which represent
gameplay moments in the video. Such as moving, attacking, or jumping. It then scans the video with these examples to find all gameplay
points in the video. Once a list is built containing timepoints, an editor preforms the necessary JSON formatting to 
allow the video to be inserted into the website. <br><br>

This project's main focus is making the process of adding videos easier for the user adding them. As of now 
the current interface requires manual insertions of gameplay points across the entire video, a long and tedious process.
